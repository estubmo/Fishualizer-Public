###### A student project developed in Unity for NTNU and Salmar AS
### Preface

The purpose of the assignment was to develop software for graphically visualizing and handling data from SalMar AS' production database FishTalk. The goal was to create a platform for discussion and guesswork. Developed in Unity using C#.

### Screenshots

The system requires importing specific .xlsx-files containing data provided by Salmar AS' FishTalk application.
This data provides the basis of what the application visualizes.

In the application you may choose what kind of data you want to visualize.

The application provides a time axis and a play function. This allows the user to see changes over time.
